Conclusion
----------
- Project implements solving of a rubick's cube
- maximal searching depth is set to 20
- Program prints nothing if no solution is found within maximal depth.
- Due to complexity of facts in a program some facts are taken from official
 rubick's solver from SWI-prolog documentation. Anyway author tried to write down
 his own facts, he even bought brand new rubick cube and a pen for that purpose but
 due his ADHD syndrome he was unable to write them down correctly :)
 (Note that almost everybody suffers from ADHD when trying to write down facts containing 54 subformulas)
- Program doesn't and is unable to check whether cube's representation represents valid cube.

About
-----
Objective of this school project is to solve rubick's cube and
 print out solution leading to solved cube

Run
---
The only source code is file rubick.pl. For compilation
run `make`. This command will create executable file `rubick`.

Usage
-------
./rubick < RUBICK_CUBE_REPR

Rubick's representation
-----------------------
Rubick's cube on input should look like this(U-Up side, D-Down, F-Front, R-Right, B-Back, L-Left)
